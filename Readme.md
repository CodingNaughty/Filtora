- Works with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Blocks all protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.)
- Beautiful and intuitive user interface
- Includes backup and restore functionality
- Customizable filtering rules
- Support for wildcards and subdomains

## üìã Prerequisites

- macOS operating system
- Administrator access (for running with sudo)
- Basic terminal knowledge
- Network interface access

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd website-blocker
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x blocker.sh unblocker.sh
   ```

3. Verify the scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   ls -l blocker.sh unblocker.sh
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration

1. Open `list.txt` in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano list.txt
   ```

2. Add the websites you want to block, one per line:
   ```
   youtube.com
   tiktok.com
   example.com
   ```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Adding Subdomains
Add specific subdomains to block:
```
www.youtube.com
m.youtube.com
api.youtube.com
```

#### Using Wildcards
For broader blocking, use wildcards:
```
*.youtube.com
*.tiktok.com
```

#### Blocking Specific Paths
Add specific paths to block:
```
youtube.com/watch
tiktok.com/@username
```

## üîí Using the Blocker

### Basic Usage

#### To Block Websites:
```bash
sudo ./blocker.sh
```

#### To Unblock Websites:
```bash
sudo ./unblocker.sh
```

### Advanced Usage

#### View Current Blocked IPs:
```bash
# View IPv4 blocked addresses
sudo pfctl -t adult_sites -T show

# View IPv6 blocked addresses
sudo pfctl -t adult_sites6 -T show
```

#### Check PF Status:
```bash
# Check if PF is enabled
sudo pfctl -s info

# View current PF rules
sudo pfctl -s rules
```

#### Manual DNS Cache Flush:
```bash
# Flush DNS cache
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

## üîß Customization

### Modifying Blocking Rules

1. Edit `blocker.sh` to customize blocking behavior:
   ```bash
   nano blocker.sh
   ```

2. Common modifications:
   - Change the interface name (default: auto-detected)
   - Modify DNS resolution timeout
   - Add custom PF rules
   - Change backup file location

### Adding Custom PF Rules

Add custom rules to the PF configuration section in `blocker.sh`:
```bash
# Example: Block specific ports
block in quick on $INTERFACE proto tcp from any to <adult_sites> port {80,443}
```

### Creating Backup Rules

The script automatically creates backups, but you can manually backup:
```bash
# Backup hosts file
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.backup

# Backup PF rules
sudo pfctl -s rules > pf_rules.backup
```

## üîç Verifying the Block

### Basic Verification
1. Try accessing blocked websites in your browser
2. Check if they're inaccessible
3. Verify in different browsers

### Advanced Verification
```bash
# Check hosts file entries
cat /etc/hosts | grep "0.0.0.0"

# Test DNS resolution
dig blocked-site.com

# Check network connections
sudo lsof -i -n
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always run the scripts with `sudo`
- The blocker modifies system files:
  - `/etc/hosts`
  - PF firewall rules
  - DNS cache
- Keep backups of original configurations
- Test changes in a controlled environment first

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Websites still accessible:
   ```bash
   # Run unblocker first
   sudo ./unblocker.sh
   
   # Clear browser cache
   # Chrome: chrome://settings/clearBrowserData
   # Safari: Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data
   
   # Run blocker again
   sudo ./blocker.sh
   ```

2. PF not working:
   ```bash
   # Check PF status
   sudo pfctl -s info
   
   # Reload PF rules
   sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
   ```

3. DNS issues:
   ```bash
   # Flush DNS cache
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
   sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   
   # Check DNS resolution
   dig example.com
   ```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

1. Check system logs:
   ```bash
   # View system logs
   log show --predicate 'process == "pfctl"'
   ```

2. Monitor network traffic:
   ```bash
   # Install tcpdump if needed
   brew install tcpdump
   
   # Monitor traffic to blocked sites
   sudo tcpdump -i en0 host youtube.com
   ```
